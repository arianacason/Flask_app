# Flask_app
This app is still in the early stages of development.

This is a Flask web application that allows users to install or upgrade an operating system on a server. The application retrieves the hostname and IP address of the server from ServiceNow, so users only need to input the hostname. They can also select the type of operating system they want to install or upgrade.

To use this app, simply enter the hostname of the server and select the desired operating system. The application will then retrieve the corresponding IP address from ServiceNow and proceed to install or upgrade the operating system on the specified server.

This app is intended for internal use only and requires valid ServiceNow credentials to retrieve server information.
